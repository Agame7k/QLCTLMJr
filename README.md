## About This Project

This configuration file was created for a local musical production of "The Little Mermaid Jr." Over 300+ hours were spent configuring and syncing all of the light scenes used in the musical. 

Please note:
- You will need to provide your own music files.
- Adjust the configuration for your fixtures. This setup was designed for a 24-channel single-color light set, with the first three channels dead and the fourth channel controlling the main lights.
- lights 11, 21-24 are considered "sea lighting" since they had a color filter on it though the color was only noticeable only when those lights were turned on
